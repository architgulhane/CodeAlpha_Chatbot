# Simple Chatbot in Python

This is a simple command-line chatbot written in Python. It responds to basic greetings and questions with random responses from a predefined set.

## Features
- Responds to greetings like "hi" and "hello"
- Answers simple questions like "how are you"
- Says goodbye when you type "bye" or "exit"
- Returns a default response for unrecognized input
- Randomizes responses for a more natural feel

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing `simple_chatbot.py`.
4. Run the chatbot with:
   
   ```powershell
   python simple_chatbot.py
   ```
5. Type your messages and interact with the chatbot. Type `exit` to quit.

## Example
```
ChatBot: Hi! Type something to start a conversation (type 'exit' to quit)
You: hi
ChatBot: Hey there!
You: how are you
ChatBot: Doing well, thank you! How can I assist?
You: bye
ChatBot: See you later!
```

## Customization
You can add more responses or keywords by editing the `responses` dictionary in `simple_chatbot.py`.
